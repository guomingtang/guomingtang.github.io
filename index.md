Hi there! Welcome to my homepage. I am an Associate Professor in the College of Systems Engineering at National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China.

Aided by the data science and AI techniques, my research mainly focuses on dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sustainability" target="_blank">computational sustainability</a> problems in computing and networking systems. Some ongoing projects include (i) energy-efficient power management in datacenters, (ii) load modeling and monitoring of smart energy systems, and (iii) resource management of cloud/edge computing systems. I am also interested in the intelligent transportation systems, especially those are data-driven and/or AI-enabled.

For more about my research, please refer to the [publications](/publications).
