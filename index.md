Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a>
and the
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/" target="_blank">Department of Engineering & Public Policy</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by 
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>
and
<a href="https://ines.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">In&#234;s Azevedo</a>.
I am also a co-founder and chair of <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">Climate Change AI</a>, an initiative to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

My work focuses on machine learning for forecasting, optimization, and control in high-renewables power grids.
Specifically, my research explores methods to incorporate the physics and hard constraints associated with electric power systems into deep learning models.
Please see [here](/publications) for a list of my recent publications.

I am a member of the MIT Technology Review's <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/innovators-under-35/2021/" target="_blank">"35 Innovators Under 35"</a> 2021 global list, and am a 2022 Siebel Scholar.
I was previously a U.S. Department of Energy
<a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/" target="_blank">Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>,
an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and a <a href="https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj" target="_blank">Thomas J. Watson Fellow</a>.
I received my undergraduate degree at Harvey Mudd College in computer science and math with an emphasis in environmental analysis.
