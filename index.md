I am currently an Associate Professor College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology. I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">University of Victoria</a>, Canada, and both the Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the National University of Defense Technology, China. I was also a visiting research scholar of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a>, Canada.

Aided by the data science and AI techniques, my research mainly focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sustainability" target="_blank">computational sustainability</a> in computing/networking systems, broadly covering (i) energy-efficient power management in datacenters, (ii) load modeling and monitoring of smart energy systems, and (iii) content delivery & resource provisioning of cloud/edge computing systems. I am also interested in the intelligent transportation systems (ITS), especially those are data-driven or AI-enabled.

For more research interests, please refer to my [publications](/publications).
