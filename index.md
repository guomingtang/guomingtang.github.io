Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a>
and the
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/" target="_blank">Department of Engineering & Public Policy</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by 
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>
and
<a href="https://ines.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">In&#234;s Azevedo</a>.
I am also co-founder and chair of <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">Climate Change AI</a>, an initiative to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

My work lies at the intersection of machine learning, electric power systems, and climate change mitigation.
Specifically, my research explores ways to incorporate domain knowledge (such as power system physics) into machine learning models. Please see [here](/publications) for a list of my recent publications.

I am funded through the U.S. Department of Energy's 
<a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/" target="_blank">Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a>
and was previously an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and a <a href="https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj" target="_blank">Thomas J. Watson Fellow</a>.
I received my undergraduate degree at Harvey Mudd College in computer science and math with an emphasis in environmental analysis.
