Hello and welcome!

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Data Science and Analytics (DSA) Thrust at the Information Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), where I lead the Sustainable Computing (SusCom) Lab. Our research leverages machine learning and data science techniques to address <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sustainability" target="_blank">computational sustainability</a> challenges, with a special focus on **AI infrastructure**. Our current research interests include:

- Energy-efficient AI model serving, particularly focusing on large language models (LLMs);
- Computational resource management, including scheduling, dispatching, and orchestrating, in cloud and edge environments.

We are also interested in developing AI-aided and practical solutions for power monitoring, modeling, and saving in **smart homes & buildings**. Typical research problems we are tackling include:

- Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) for smart homes;
- Integrating LLM agents into building energy systems (BESs).
