Hello and welcome!

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Data Science and Analytics (DSA) Thrust at the Information Hub, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou).

I lead the Sustainable Computing (SusCom) Lab, where we apply machine learning and data science techniques to address <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_sustainability" target="_blank">computational sustainability</a> challenges, particularly focusing on **AI infrastructure**. Our current research interests include:

- Energy-efficient AI model serving, with a special emphasis on large language models (LLMs);
- Computational resource management, including scheduling, dispatching, and orchestrating, in cloud and edge environments.

We are also interested in developing (real) intelligent and practical solutions for power monitoring, modeling, and control in **smart homes \& buildings**. Typical research problems we are tackling include:

- Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) for smart homes;
- Integrating LLM agents into building energy systems (BESs).


<span style="color:red">**Recruitment:**</span> I am actively seeking self-motivated PhD students, RAs, and Interns to join my research team. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts.
