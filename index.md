Hello! I am a Co-founder and Chair of <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">Climate Change AI</a> (CCAI), an initiative to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. I am currently running CCAI through the <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/phd/startup-postdocs/">Runway Startup Postdoc Program</a>, hosted by <a href="https://www.tech.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell Tech</a> and the <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/jacobs-technion-cornell-institute/">Jacobs Institute</a>. I will also join <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT EECS</a> as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023, and am currently recruiting Ph.D. students and postdocs.

My research focuses on machine learning for forecasting, optimization, and control in high-renewables power grids.
Specifically, my work explores methods to incorporate the physics and hard constraints associated with electric power systems into deep learning models.
Please see [here](/publications) for a list of my recent publications.

I am a recipient of the MIT Technology Review's 2021 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/innovators-under-35/2021/" target="_blank">"35 Innovators Under 35"</a> award.
I was previously a U.S. Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow, a Siebel Scholar,
an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and a Thomas J. Watson Fellow.
I received my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a>
and the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/" target="_blank">Department of Engineering & Public Policy</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by 
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>
and
<a href="https://ines.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">In&#234;s Azevedo</a>.
I did my undergraduate degree at Harvey Mudd College, with a major in computer science and math as well as an emphasis in environmental analysis.
