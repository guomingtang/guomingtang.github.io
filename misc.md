  > Set goals that are ambitious and do not be seduced by what is easy but trivial. (Venki Ramakrishnan)  
  > A quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest. (Einstein)  
  > Tell me and I forget; show me and I remember; involve me and I understand. (Xunzi)
