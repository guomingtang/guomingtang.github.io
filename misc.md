- Some quotes I like:
  - For daily: _"Embrace the highs, maintain the pace; face the lows, persevere with grace." (Unknown author)_ 
  - For research: _"Set goals that are ambitious and do not be seduced by what is easy but trivial." (Venki Ramakrishnan)_ 
  - For teaching: _"Tell me and I forget; show me and I remember; involve me and I understand." (Xunzi)_
  - For life: _"A quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest." (Einstein)_
